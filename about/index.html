			 	<h1>About Angela</h1>
			  <span class="post-date">Wed, Apr 9, 2014</span>
			      <hr />

<p>It was a sunny spring afternoon. We were sitting in a coffeeshop filled with idle chatter. Across from me sat the man who kickstarted my career by giving me my first full time job. A lot has happened since the day we first met. The conversation had suddenly taken a deep turn. I was talking about that lingering feeling of doubt that lives with me. The doubt that what I&rsquo;ll do and the things I&rsquo;ll conquer will never be enough - that I will always want more.</p>

<p>Everyone sees the fire and the ambition, but they don&rsquo;t see the fear that drives me. I don&rsquo;t know how not chase these dreams. Will I find a journey that has meaning to me, and to others, I wonder? If my life ended tomorrow, would I have left an impact on anyone? Would I be remembered?</p>

<p>As I was trying to articulate this, there was this moment where he looked at me, head slightly tilted. A heavy pause, as the door swung open and the shop engulfed the newest visitors in the heady aroma of ground coffee. And he asked me, <i>&ldquo;Angela, are you searching for <b>significance?&rdquo;</i></b>&ldquo;</p>

<p>The question has stuck in my head since. I had never quite heard it put that way. But it is the question I am chasing after. The answer I want to find. Is this the calling that people speak of? When they find work that sustains the soul? Who am I? What do I really want? What greatness am I meant for in this world? I don&rsquo;t know yet.</p>

<p>I hope to find out.</p>

<h3>My name is Angela.</h3>

<p>This is my hybrid portfolio-blog filled with data things and the thoughts that fill my head and keep me up at night. Hope you enjoy the read!</p>
